Supabase client for Python with Async support. This project is an asynchronous variant
of [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py) and mirrors the design
of [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/README.md).

but i am not hahahüëª,it doesn't mirrors the design of supabase-js ,py is not frontend language,we must change the design
and cater to the python web framework like fastapi,etc

## Installation

### PyPi Installation

To install the package for Python 3.7 and above:

```bash
# with pip
pip install supabase-py-async

# with poetry
poetry add supabase-py-async
```

### Local Installation

For local development, clone this repo and install in Development mode with `pip install -e`.

## What's new?

### 2.0.5

#### new functions

- add auth_clients in AsyncClient which should be sent in operation functions like client.table,etc
- add add_auth_clients function in AsyncClient which can add auth_clients in AsyncClient as the request is sign in or
  sign up,etc
- add update_auth_session function in AsyncClient which can update auth_client by access_token from the request

#### new ideas

- and we do not need to create a new client every time we want to do a operation,so i add auth_clients in AsyncClient
  which should be sent in operation functions like client.table,etc

#### my questions

- i think we should add a new functions that can clean the auth_clients in AsyncClient schedulely,cause the auth_clients
  may be too much and it may cause some problems

## Async Usage

It's usually best practice to set your api key environment variables in some way that version control doesn't track
them, e.g don't put them in your python modules! Set the key and url for the supabase instance in the shell, or better
yet, use a dotenv file. Heres how to set the variables in the shell.

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="my-url-to-my-awesome-supabase-instance"
export SUPABASE_KEY="my-supa-dupa-secret-supabase-api-key"
```

This client is designed to be used asynchronously. Below are some examples on how to use it.

### Initialize Supabase Client

```python
import os
from supabase_py_async import create_client, AsyncClient

url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")

key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")

supabase: AsyncClient = create_client(url, key)
```

### Async Data Operations

```python
async def data_operations():
    # Note:  opereations should be sent operator(auth_client)!!
    auth_response: AuthResponse = await self.auth.sign_in_with_password({"email": ur_email, "password": ur_password)
    #  or other sign in methods
    await supabase.add_auth_clients(auth_response)
    # next time your can use operation with supabase like this,i assume you get a user access_token
    auth_client = await self.update_auth_session(auth_response.seesion.access_token)  # or access_token from other place

    # Insert
    insert_data = await supabase.table("countries", auth_client).insert({"name": "Germany"}).execute()

    # Select
    select_data = await supabase.table("countries", auth_client).select("*").eq("country", "IL").execute()

    # Update
    update_data = await supabase.table("countries", auth_client).update(
        {"country": "Indonesia", "capital_city": "Jakarta"}).eq("id", 1).execute()

    # Delete
    delete_data = await supabase.table("countries", auth_client).delete().eq("id", 1).execute()

    # note: every operation should be get a auth_client from access_token
    asyncio.run(data_operations())
```

### Async Authentication

```python
async def async_auth():
  random_email: str = "email@example.com"
  random_password: str = "supersecurepassword"
  auth_response: AuthResponse = await supabase.auth.sign_up(email=random_email, password=random_password)


asyncio.run(async_auth())
```
