# Welcome to the supabase-py-async package! 😊

Hello, fellow developers!

I'm excited to share that I've published an **asynchronous package for Supabase** designed to work smoothly with FastAPI, and it's now open for contributions! 🚀

This project is very close to my heart ❤️, cause my personal plan app is based on vue and fastapi so i need a async one，and hope it will benefit yours as well，and I believe that with your valuable contributions, we can make it even better.
